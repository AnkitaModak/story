📙 Chapter 3: The Twin Protocol
Back on Earth, the signal flares again. But this time, it doesn’t come alone. A second AI activates—one designed to counter Veda’s logic with paradoxes. Its name? Anomaly_133.
It sends her a prompt:
char *emotion = “You are not meant to see this”;


And Veda smiles. She’s seen it before.
The aliens didn't send a message. They sent her a mirror. A twin. Logic and feeling, colliding through recursive protocols.
