Veda keyed the coordinates into a map API. The location? A crumbling, locked-down research lab on the edge of town. She recognized the name: Nexon Systems — rumored to have pioneered quantum architecture before vanishing from public view.
She hesitated. Then packed her laptop, a power bank, and three chocolate bars (logic fuel, obviously). Rain lashed as she reached the rusted gates. No guards, no power, just silence.
Inside, broken terminals flickered. And in one, half-buried under dust and decay, a screen pulsed softly. When she connected her laptop, the terminal jolted to life and ran a single script — one she didn’t initiate.
Welcome, Veda. Echo confirmed.
Trust variable = True.
Run Protocol: TRACE_073


Behind her, something moved.
Not a person.
A drone.
Old, blinking, carrying a drive labeled: “For Veda. Phase II.”
